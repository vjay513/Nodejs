# Nodejs

Week1:

Task1 : 
Write a program which reads a string from the standard input stdin, reverses it and then writes it to
the standard output stdout.
• The program should be started from npm script via nodemon (i.e. npm run task1).
• The program should be running in a stand-by mode and should not be terminated after the
first-string processing.
