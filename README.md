# Nodejs

Week1:

Task1 : 

Write a program which reads a string from the standard input stdin, reverses it and then writes it to
the standard output stdout.

• The program should be started from npm script via nodemon (i.e. npm run task1).

• The program should be running in a stand-by mode and should not be terminated after the first-string processing.

Write a program which should do the following:

• Read the content of csv file from ./csv directory. Example: https://epa.ms/nodejs19-hw1-ex1

• Use the csvtojson package (https://github.com/Keyang/node-csvtojson) to convert csv file to
json object.

• Write the csv file content to a new txt file.
Use the following format: https://epa.ms/nodejs19-hw1-ex2.

• Do not load all the content of the csv file into RAM via stream (read/write file content line by
line).

• In case of read/write errors, log them in the console.

• The program should be started via npm script using nodemon (i.e. npm run task2).

TASK 1.3

Rewrite the above-mentioned programs to use babel (https://babeljs.io/) and ES6 modules.
